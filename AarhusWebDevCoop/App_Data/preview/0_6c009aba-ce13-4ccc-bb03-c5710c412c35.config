        <articleContent><![CDATA[<p>Nearly a million miles from Earth is the greatest little mapmaker that ever existed. It is located at a gravitationally stable point in space on the opposite side of our planet from the sun. It had better be great because it has a huge job: To paint a three-dimensional picture of the entire galaxy. Our galaxy is a structure measuring 100,000 light years across. A light-year is a unit of distance equal to the distance that light travels in one year—5.88 trillion miles. This is an awful lot of territory to keep your eye on.</p>

<p>The mapmaker is the Gaia satellite. It is a 4,500-pound craft launched by the European Space Agency in 2013. Gaia’s mission managers don’t pretend they can spot every object in the galaxy. It includes an estimated 300 billion stars, planets, moons, asteroids and more. But a good 1 billion stars ought to help the managers measure the Milky Way overall. The objects should reveal new clues about the galaxy’s structure, formation, and history.</p>
<p>This image, released on September 14, provides a first rough glimpse at the map to come. So far, Gaia has exceeded its original goal. It has gotten a reasonably good handle on 1.142 billion stars. Much more precise positional measurements, along with the stars’ apparent motion relative to Earth, are still to come.</p>
<p>Space is a very big place. It will be a long, long time before we map it all. But Gaia offers a good start.</p>]]></articleContent>

<p>After a record-setting 31 months on the moon’s surface, China’s Jade Rabbit lunar rover officially ended its mission. According to Chinese officials, the unmanned rover powered down on July 28, ceasing all operations</p>
<p>Before entering hibernation mode, Jade Rabbit, or Yutu in Chinese, posted a final goodbye on Weibo, a Twitter-like website. “I’m a rabbit that has seen the most stars!” the post said.</p>
<p><strong>A Historic Mission</strong></p>
<p>Jade Rabbit arrived on the moon on December 14, 2013, aboard the Chang-e 3 lander. The names of the lunar lander and rover are rooted in Chinese mythology. Chang’e is the name of a mythical Chinese goddess who is said to</p>

<p>live on the moon. Yutu was her pet rabbit.</p>
<p>In its 972 operational days, Jade Rabbit snapped photos and collected samples with its powerful cameras, telescopes, and radar. The data it gathered helped scientists better understand how the moon has evolved over time. Now that its mission is complete, Jade Rabbit will remain on the moon.</p>
<p>The rover far exceeded engineers’ expectations. It was designed to operate for just three months, but Jade Rabbit continued to collect and transmit data for more than two-and-a-half years. The rover’s stay on the moon was more than three times longer than the previous record, set by the former Soviet Union’s Lunohkod 1, in 1970.</p>
<p><strong>China’s Next Steps</strong></p>
<p>Next year, China will attempt to land an unmanned spaceship on the lunar surface that would return to Earth with samples. Only the United States and Russia have successfully completed a return trip from the moon.</p>
<p>China has been developing its space program since the country sent its first astronaut to space in 2003. It has since sent an experimental space station into orbit. In February, China announced it would deploy a second station by the end of this year. The plan is to send along with two crewmembers to stay onboard.</p>

        <articleContent><![CDATA[<p>September is National Childhood Obesity Month, a major topic for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The agency’s program HealthierUS School Challenge: Smarter Lunchrooms (HUSSC: SL) takes aim against childhood obesity by helping more students across the country gain access to fresh, wholesome foods. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack says the USDA is especially focused on children living in food insecure homes, or households that can’t afford to provide enough food for all members of the family every day.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, many students don’t get adequate nutrition due to family circumstances or situations,” Vilsack told TFK. “Seventeen million children in school today are living in food insecure homes.”</p>
<p>According to the Food Research and Action Center, low-income neighborhoods typically lack access to full-service grocery stores and farmers’ markets where a variety of fresh fruit and vegetables are sold. Additionally, fresh foods tend to be more expensive. Households with tight budgets may buy cheaper food products, which tend to be processed and less healthy. Without steady access to nutritious food options, kids can develop health issues.</p>
<p>“Youngsters can get chronic diseases such as diabetes or heart issues,” Vilsack says. He adds that these conditions can make kids less productive, and increase health-care costs for their parents.</p>
<p><strong>Making Better School Meals</strong></p>
<p>Millions of children in the U.S. depend on meals provided by their schools. In 2012, the most recent year for which data is available, more than 31 million children ate school lunches, and 12.5 million ate school breakfasts. HUSSC:SL, which is voluntary, aims to make the most out of school meals. It recognizes schools that have enrolled in Team Nutrition, a USDA program that helps schools prepare healthy meals and promote nutrition and physical education.</p>
<p>There are four levels of Team Nutrition recognition: bronze, silver, gold, and the gold award of distinction. For each level, schools must complete the Smarter Lunchrooms Self-Assessment Scorecard. This checklist asks schools to consider everything from access to low-fat white milk to how their lunch menus are designed. To qualify for bronze, schools must offer at least 30 items on the checklist. Silver or gold applicants must offer 50 items, while the highest level, gold distinction, must offer 70. Schools that achieve each standard may receive USDA grants and are added to a list of winners on Team Nutrition’s website.</p>

</div>
<p>Vilsack says that before he became USDA Secretary in 2009, only 100 schools qualified for Team Nutrition recognition. Since then, many schools have made changes to their menus and education programs. Now more than 6,000 schools nationwide have earned recognition.</p>
<p>The USDA is not alone in this cause. “First Lady Michelle Obama’s <em>Let’s Move</em> Campaign has also helped,” Vilsack says. “They’ve worked in conjunction with the Healthier U.S. Schools Challenge to spread the message.”</p>]]></articleContent>

        <articleContent><![CDATA[<p>While sweet treats can be hard to resist, the World Health Organization (WHO) has set new dietary guidelines for people around the world. The guidelines, released on Wednesday, advise that both adults and children cut back on their sugar intake to stay healthy.</p>
<p>In a statement, Francesco Branca, director of the WHO’s nutrition department, said there is “solid evidence” that reducing daily sugar intake “reduces the risk of overweight, obesity, and tooth decay.”</p>
<p><strong>Keep it Fresh</strong></p>
<p>The guidelines do not apply to the sugars in fresh fruits and vegetables or those that are naturally present in milk. According to the WHO, there is no reported evidence of negative effects of consuming those sugars. Instead, the new guidelines focus on “added” or “free” sugars. These include sugars that are added to processed foods and drinks such as donuts, cookies, candy, and soft drinks.</p>
<p>Added sugars are sometimes described as “hidden” sugars because they exist in foods we might not think of as sweets, such as honey and ketchup. Health experts advise that consumers look at ingredients on food packages to help make better-informed decisions.</p>

<div class="caption">A family enjoys a picnic meal of fresh fruits and vegetables.</div>
</div>
<p><strong>A Worldwide Concern</strong></p>
<p>The WHO recommends that people in the United States, Europe, and other Western societies should cut their average sugar intake by about two-thirds, or down to just 10% of their overall calories. For developing countries, where dental care is less advanced and cavities are more difficult to prevent, the WHO recommends that sugar intake be reduced to 5%.</p>
<p>In the U.S., adults currently get about 11 to 15% of their calories from added sugars. Children typically consume even more, as it can account for up to 16% of their diets. In Europe, sugar intake varies by country. For adults in Hungary and Norway, it is about 7%. In Spain and the United Kingdom, sugar makes up as much as 17% of adults’ diets. The WHO reports that for children in Europe, sugar intake can be much higher, ranging from about 12% in Denmark, Slovenia, and Sweden, to nearly 25% in Portugal.</p>
<p>“The trouble is, we really do like sugar in a lot of things,” said scientist Kieran Clarke, of the University of Oxford. “Even if you are not just eating lollies and candy, you are probably eating a fair amount of sugar.”</p>
<p>But Clarke also notes that for those people who can’t shake their love for sweets, getting more exercise is a good solution. “If you get enough exercise, you can eat almost anything,” she said. “But it’s very hard to avoid large amounts of sugar unless all you’re eating is fruits and vegetables.”</p>]]></articleContent>

Most people obtain their drinking water from Lake Victoria, seasonal rivers and streams, and hand-dug wells. All of these sources are contaminated. Women and children walk up to six kilometers each day to haul water, a task that can take three hours. Water is not only contaminated at its source but also from the way it is transported and stored.</span></p>]]></projectDescription>

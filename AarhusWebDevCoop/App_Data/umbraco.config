        <articleContent><![CDATA[<p>Nearly a million miles from Earth is the greatest little mapmaker that ever existed. It is located at a gravitationally stable point in space on the opposite side of our planet from the sun. It had better be great because it has a huge job: To paint a three-dimensional picture of the entire galaxy. Our galaxy is a structure measuring 100,000 light years across. A light-year is a unit of distance equal to the distance that light travels in one year—5.88 trillion miles. This is an awful lot of territory to keep your eye on.</p>

</div>
<p>The mapmaker is the Gaia satellite. It is a 4,500-pound craft launched by the European Space Agency in 2013. Gaia’s mission managers don’t pretend they can spot every object in the galaxy. It includes an estimated 300 billion stars, planets, moons, asteroids and more. But a good 1 billion stars ought to help the managers measure the Milky Way overall. The objects should reveal new clues about the galaxy’s structure, formation, and history.</p>
<p>This image, released on September 14, provides a first rough glimpse at the map to come. So far, Gaia has exceeded its original goal. It has gotten a reasonably good handle on 1.142 billion stars. Much more precise positional measurements, along with the stars’ apparent motion relative to Earth, are still to come.</p>
<p>Space is a very big place. It will be a long, long time before we map it all. But Gaia offers a good start.</p>]]></articleContent>

<p>After a record-setting 31 months on the moon’s surface, China’s Jade Rabbit lunar rover officially ended its mission. According to Chinese officials, the unmanned rover powered down on July 28, ceasing all operations</p>
<p>Before entering hibernation mode, Jade Rabbit, or Yutu in Chinese, posted a final goodbye on Weibo, a Twitter-like website. “I’m a rabbit that has seen the most stars!” the post said.</p>
<p><strong>A Historic Mission</strong></p>
<p>Jade Rabbit arrived on the moon on December 14, 2013, aboard the Chang-e 3 lander. The names of the lunar lander and rover are rooted in Chinese mythology. Chang’e is the name of a mythical Chinese goddess who is said to</p>

<p>live on the moon. Yutu was her pet rabbit.</p>
<p>In its 972 operational days, Jade Rabbit snapped photos and collected samples with its powerful cameras, telescopes, and radar. The data it gathered helped scientists better understand how the moon has evolved over time. Now that its mission is complete, Jade Rabbit will remain on the moon.</p>
<p>The rover far exceeded engineers’ expectations. It was designed to operate for just three months, but Jade Rabbit continued to collect and transmit data for more than two-and-a-half years. The rover’s stay on the moon was more than three times longer than the previous record, set by the former Soviet Union’s Lunohkod 1, in 1970.</p>
<p><strong>China’s Next Steps</strong></p>
<p>Next year, China will attempt to land an unmanned spaceship on the lunar surface that would return to Earth with samples. Only the United States and Russia have successfully completed a return trip from the moon.</p>
<p>China has been developing its space program since the country sent its first astronaut to space in 2003. It has since sent an experimental space station into orbit. In February, China announced it would deploy a second station by the end of this year. The plan is to send along with two crewmembers to stay onboard.</p>

        <articleContent><![CDATA[<p>September is National Childhood Obesity Month, a major topic for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The agency’s program HealthierUS School Challenge: Smarter Lunchrooms (HUSSC: SL) takes aim against childhood obesity by helping more students across the country gain access to fresh, wholesome foods. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack says the USDA is especially focused on children living in food insecure homes, or households that can’t afford to provide enough food for all members of the family every day.</p>

</div>
<p>“Unfortunately, many students don’t get adequate nutrition due to family circumstances or situations,” Vilsack told TFK. “Seventeen million children in school today are living in food insecure homes.”</p>
<p>According to the Food Research and Action Center, low-income neighborhoods typically lack access to full-service grocery stores and farmers’ markets where a variety of fresh fruit and vegetables are sold. Additionally, fresh foods tend to be more expensive. Households with tight budgets may buy cheaper food products, which tend to be processed and less healthy. Without steady access to nutritious food options, kids can develop health issues.</p>
<p>“Youngsters can get chronic diseases such as diabetes or heart issues,” Vilsack says. He adds that these conditions can make kids less productive, and increase health-care costs for their parents.</p>
<p><strong>Making Better School Meals</strong></p>
<p>Millions of children in the U.S. depend on meals provided by their schools. In 2012, the most recent year for which data is available, more than 31 million children ate school lunches, and 12.5 million ate school breakfasts. HUSSC:SL, which is voluntary, aims to make the most out of school meals. It recognizes schools that have enrolled in Team Nutrition, a USDA program that helps schools prepare healthy meals and promote nutrition and physical education.</p>
<p>There are four levels of Team Nutrition recognition: bronze, silver, gold, and the gold award of distinction. For each level, schools must complete the Smarter Lunchrooms Self-Assessment Scorecard. This checklist asks schools to consider everything from access to low-fat white milk to how their lunch menus are designed. To qualify for bronze, schools must offer at least 30 items on the checklist. Silver or gold applicants must offer 50 items, while the highest level, gold distinction, must offer 70. Schools that achieve each standard may receive USDA grants and are added to a list of winners on Team Nutrition’s website.</p>

</div>
<p>Vilsack says that before he became USDA Secretary in 2009, only 100 schools qualified for Team Nutrition recognition. Since then, many schools have made changes to their menus and education programs. Now more than 6,000 schools nationwide have earned recognition.</p>
<p>The USDA is not alone in this cause. “First Lady Michelle Obama’s <em>Let’s Move</em> Campaign has also helped,” Vilsack says. “They’ve worked in conjunction with the Healthier U.S. Schools Challenge to spread the message.”</p>]]></articleContent>

        <articleContent><![CDATA[<p>While sweet treats can be hard to resist, the World Health Organization (WHO) has set new dietary guidelines for people around the world. The guidelines, released on Wednesday, advise that both adults and children cut back on their sugar intake to stay healthy.</p>
<p>In a statement, Francesco Branca, director of the WHO’s nutrition department, said there is “solid evidence” that reducing daily sugar intake “reduces the risk of overweight, obesity, and tooth decay.”</p>
<p><strong>Keep it Fresh</strong></p>
<p>The guidelines do not apply to the sugars in fresh fruits and vegetables or those that are naturally present in milk. According to the WHO, there is no reported evidence of negative effects of consuming those sugars. Instead, the new guidelines focus on “added” or “free” sugars. These include sugars that are added to processed foods and drinks such as donuts, cookies, candy, and soft drinks.</p>
<p>Added sugars are sometimes described as “hidden” sugars because they exist in foods we might not think of as sweets, such as honey and ketchup. Health experts advise that consumers look at ingredients on food packages to help make better-informed decisions.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>A Worldwide Concern</strong></p>
<p>The WHO recommends that people in the United States, Europe, and other Western societies should cut their average sugar intake by about two-thirds, or down to just 10% of their overall calories. For developing countries, where dental care is less advanced and cavities are more difficult to prevent, the WHO recommends that sugar intake be reduced to 5%.</p>
<p>In the U.S., adults currently get about 11 to 15% of their calories from added sugars. Children typically consume even more, as it can account for up to 16% of their diets. In Europe, sugar intake varies by country. For adults in Hungary and Norway, it is about 7%. In Spain and the United Kingdom, sugar makes up as much as 17% of adults’ diets. The WHO reports that for children in Europe, sugar intake can be much higher, ranging from about 12% in Denmark, Slovenia, and Sweden, to nearly 25% in Portugal.</p>
<p>“The trouble is, we really do like sugar in a lot of things,” said scientist Kieran Clarke, of the University of Oxford. “Even if you are not just eating lollies and candy, you are probably eating a fair amount of sugar.”</p>
<p>But Clarke also notes that for those people who can’t shake their love for sweets, getting more exercise is a good solution. “If you get enough exercise, you can eat almost anything,” she said. “But it’s very hard to avoid large amounts of sugar unless all you’re eating is fruits and vegetables.”</p>]]></articleContent>

<p><strong>Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his “I HAVE A DREAM” speech on August 28, 1963, at the Lincoln Memorial, Washington D.C.</strong></p>
<p><em>(PHOTO below is of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., waving to supporters on August 28, 1963 from the Lincoln Memorial on the Mall in Washington D.C. during the “March on Washington.” Dr. King delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.) Read the speech below:</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.studentnewsdaily.com/?attachment_id=5553"><img class="alignright wp-image-5553 size-medium" src="https://www.studentnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/mlkspeech-206x300.jpg" alt="" title="mlkspeech" width="206" height="300" /></a>I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.</p>
<p>Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves, who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.</p>
<p>But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we’ve come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.</p>
<p>In a sense we have come to our nation’s capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked “insufficient funds.”</p>
<p>But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so we have come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.</p>
<p>We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God’s children.</p>
<p>It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro’s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.</p>
<p>But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must ever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-31330 size-large" src="http://www.studentnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mlk-590x295.jpg" alt="At United Nations Plaza, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. told an estimated 125,000 peace marchers that the United States should end the bombing of North Vietnam" width="590" height="295" />The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.</p>
<p>And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, “When will you be satisfied?” We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.</p>
<p>I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecutions and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends. And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal.</p>
<p>I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.</p>
<p>I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.</p>
<p>I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today!</p>
<p>I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification; one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today!</p>
<p>I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is our hope. This is the faith that I will go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day. And this will be the day, this will be the day when all of God’s children will be able to sing with new meaning, “My country ’tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim’s pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring!” And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">And so let freedom ring – from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let freedom ring – from the mighty mountains of New York.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let freedom ring – from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let freedom ring – from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let freedom ring – from the curvaceous slopes of California.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But not only that.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let freedom ring – from Stone Mountain of Georgia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let freedom ring – from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let freedom ring – from every hill and molehill of Mississippi, from every mountainside, let freedom ring!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And when this happens, when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God’s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual,</p>

<p>Everyone deserves a vacation. Whether you’re loaded down with work, stressed out about the political climate, or simply need to escape the planet for some rest and relaxation, the Intergalactic Travel Bureau is here to help! </p>
<p>We've planned space vacations for thousands of satisfied customers in the U.K. and U.S., thanks in part to our Kickstarter-backed project in 2014, when over a thousand supporters helped us bring the unique experience of planning a holiday to space on a three-city tour. We've planned vacations for clients to as near as Low Earth Orbit and as far away as distant galaxies, sparking conversations about the challenges and rewards of vacationing in the great void.</p>
<p>Now we're bringing the joy of a trip to space to anyone with our virtual reality app. With the power of your smartphone, and a simple VR viewer, you can enter the Intergalactic Travel Bureau from anywhere on the planet, and be transported to other worlds. You dream vacation is waiting...inside your pocket!</p>]]></projectDescription>

<p>Besides that, robotics is just plain cool. Nothing else makes kids' eyes light up like a robot. That is why were are working to create these robotic STEM kits to get kids excited about technology and its possibilities.</p>

<p>Coding (or computer programming) is a new type of literacy. Just as writing helps you organize your thinking and express your ideas, the same is true for coding. In the past, coding was seen as too difficult for most people. But we think coding should be for everyone, just like writing.</p>
<p>As young children code with ScratchJr, they learn how to create and express themselves with the computer, not just interact with it. In the process, children develop design and problem-solving skills that are foundational for later academic success, and they use math and language in a meaningful and motivating context, supporting the development of early-childhood numeracy and literacy.</p>
<p>With ScratchJr, children aren’t just learning to code, they are coding to learn.</p>

        <projectDescription><![CDATA[<p>A Coding App Created with Girls in Mind</p>
<p>We’ve introduced and tested Vidcode across the country and one thing is clear: girls love it.</p>
<p>When girls code effects for their videos with Vidcode, they’re excited to see that they, too, can be computer programmers. It opens up a whole world of possibilities for them in creative technology.</p>
<p>This is why we’re reaching out to you and the Kickstarter community, so we can continue to develop Vidcode and reach girls coast-to-coast. Our Kickstarter funds will be used to develop more content for our app users and to deliver our first product to schools.</p>
<p>The Vidcode Story</p>
<p>As women professionals in computer science, we discovered a shared passion for working in technology, but felt a mutual chagrin that the tech world is still heavily male-dominated. We wanted to find a way to teach girls that coding and working in tech is creative and fun. So we spoke with girls. We learned how disconnected they feel from computer science classes (we knew how that felt), and the misperceptions, i.e., tech is boring. Soon after, we created Vidcode, a video coding app that is not only self-expressive, but paired with a hobby girls love – creating and sharing videos. </p>

<p>That's up to you! First, load up a computer program or any webpage (yes that's right, you're surfing the internet to invent). </p>
<p>Let's say you load up a piano. Then, instead of using the computer keyboard buttons to play the piano, you can hook up the <a href="http://makeymakey.com/" target="_blank">MaKey MaKey</a> to something fun, like bananas, and the bananas become your piano keys:  </p>

<p>Or let's say you Google for an online "Pacman" game and draw a joystick with a pencil (yes, an actual ordinary pencil):</p>

<p>When you touch the apple, you make a connection, and MaKey MaKey sends the computer a keyboard message. The computer just thinks MaKey MaKey is a regular keyboard (or mouse). Therefore it works with all programs and webpages, because all programs and webpages take keyboard and mouse input. </p>

</div>
<div class="full-description js-full-description responsive-media formatted-lists">
<p>Artificial intelligence is growing exponentially. There is no doubt about that. Self-driving cars are clocking up millions of miles, IBM Watson is diagnosing patients better than armies of doctors and Google Deepmind's AlphaGo beat the World champion at Go - a game where intuition plays a key role.</p>
<p>But the further AI advances, the more complex become the problems it needs to solve. And only Deep Learning can solve such complex problems and that's why it's at the heart of Artificial intelligence.</p>
<div class="template asset" data-id="15698223"><img class="fit" src="https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/698/223/87f9df5fcce456d30bf97791e8f06c10_original.png?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1488380564&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=2f6b8a416d9804badbd41c8b80e42f6c" alt="" /></div>
<p>Deep Learning A-Z™ is not just an online course: it's a journey - a training program specifically designed to accompany you into the world of Deep Learning.</p>
<p>Learning should be fun, but we all know that it can also be a hassle. Especially, with such a complex topic. To gain new skills too many of us depend on courses without structure, indifferent instructors and boring case studies.</p>
<p>So, we set out to design a course that is better than anything else available. Here are five reasons we think Deep Learning A-Z™ really is different, and better, than any other training program out there:</p>
<div class="template asset" data-id="15697105"><img class="fit" src="https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/697/105/dd77545cac6ba48af4442e3d35f16577_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1488374589&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=8bac38a6ee8b3a301711354db863767b" alt="" /></div>
<h1 id="h:1-robust-structure">1. ROBUST STRUCTURE </h1>
<p>The first and most important thing we focused on is giving the course a robust structure. Deep Learning is very broad and complex and to navigate this maze you need a clear and global vision of it. </p>
<p>That's why we grouped the tutorials into two volumes, representing the two fundamental branches of Deep Learning: Supervised Deep Learning and Unsupervised Deep Learning. With each volume focusing on three distinct algorithms, we found that this is the best structure for mastering Deep Learning.</p>
<h1 id="h:2-intuition-tutorial">2. INTUITION TUTORIALS</h1>
<p>So many courses and books just bombard you with the theory, and math, and coding... But they forget to explain, perhaps, the most important part: why you are doing what you are doing. And that's how this course is so different. We focus on developing an intuitive *feel* for the concepts behind Deep Learning algorithms.</p>
<p>With our intuition tutorials you will be confident that you understand all the techniques on an instinctive level. And once you proceed to the hands-on coding exercises you will see for yourself how much more meaningful your experience will be. This is a game-changer.</p>
<h1 id="h:3-exciting-projects">3. EXCITING PROJECTS</h1>
<p>Are you tired of courses based on over-used, outdated data sets?</p>
<p>Yes? Well then you're in for a treat.</p>
<p>Inside this class we will work on Real-World datasets, to solve Real-World business problems. (Definitely not the boring iris or digit classification datasets that we see in every course). In this course we will solve six real-world challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Artificial Neural Networks to solve a Customer Churn problem</li>
<li>Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Recognition</li>
<li>Recurrent Neural Networks to predict Stock Prices</li>
<li>Self-Organizing Maps to investigate Fraud</li>
<li>Boltzmann Machines to create a Recomender System</li>
<li>Stacked Autoencoders* to take on the challenge for the Netflix $1 Million prize</li>
</ul>
<p>*Stacked Autoencoders is a brand new technique in Deep Learning which didn't even exist a couple of years ago. We haven't seen this method explained anywhere else in sufficient depth.</p>
<h1 id="h:4-hands-on-coding">4. HANDS-ON CODING </h1>
<p>In Deep Learning A-Z™ we code together with you. Every practical tutorial starts with a blank page and we write up the code from scratch. This way you can follow along and understand exactly how the code comes together and what each line means. </p>
<p>In addition, we will purposefully structure the code in such a way so that you can download it and apply it in your own projects. Moreover, we explain step-by-step where and how to modify the code to insert YOUR dataset, to tailor the algorithm to your needs, to get the output that you are after. </p>
<p>This is a course which naturally extends into your career.</p>
<h1 id="h:5-in-course-support">5. IN-COURSE SUPPORT</h1>
<p>Have you ever taken a course or read a book where you have questions but cannot reach the author? </p>
<p>Well, this course is different. We are fully committed to making this the most disruptive and powerful Deep Learning course on the planet. With that comes a responsibility to constantly be there when you need our help.</p>
<p>In fact, since we physically also need to eat and sleep we have put together a team of professional Data Scientists to help us out. Whenever you ask a question you will get a response from us within 48 hours maximum. </p>
<p>No matter how complex your query, we will be there. The bottom line is we want you to succeed. </p>

<h1 id="h:introducing-nb-iot-f">Introducing: NB-IoT for everyone</h1>
<p>There was a time when driving a car was considered a luxury. Sure, there were roads. And there were cars. But not until Henry Ford made them affordable and easy to get, it became the commodity we are used to now. Same with smartphones. The iPhone was by no means the first smartphone. But Steve Jobs managed to make it appealing and available for a large group of people. Now we can’t imagine a life without our smartphone. And experts agree the Internet of Things is heading the same way. It is estimated that roughly 50 billion devices are connected to the internet by the year 2020.</p>
<p>To achieve that, you need good networks that can securely and reliably transfer data, without using too much power. That’s why telecom providers all over the world are investing in and rolling out NarrowBand-IoT (NB-IoT) networks on their existing infrastructure. The new, 4G telecommunication standard is set to empower the future of IoT. But which hardware is going to use that new network?</p>
<p>That is the question we were asking ourselves. Looking back, most of the time big companies were the first and only ones having access to new technologies. They had the resources to leverage on new technologies and were able to build new competitive advantages, leaving others behind. We at SODAQ want to change that and offer you the chance to be the first: we want to put NB-IoT in your hands. Now. Today. We will do that by providing the tools that millions of makers already know how to use. And we will make those tools very affordable and usable. We are enabling exactly that with our NB-IoT Arduino Shield. It’s NB-IoT for everyone.</p>

<h1 id="h:how-does-nectarjs-wo">How does NectarJS work ?</h1>
<p>NectarJS is a SAAS compiler ( a CAAS, Compiler As A Service) : you download the NectarJS client, you write your code, and you ask to NectarJS client to send your code to compile to NectarJS servers. Your code is sent encrypted, compiled in an encrypted ramdisk, and the result is sent back to you, encrypted. So, your code is safe.</p>]]></projectDescription>
